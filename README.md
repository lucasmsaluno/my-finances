<h1>
  Project 💻
</h1>
<p>
 
A Expense Tracking Application made with jetpack compose. I made this app with the aim of deepening my study of concepts such as room database, viewModels, dependency injection and navigation. It's a simple crud that allows you to add and remove transactions and see the results at the top of the application.
